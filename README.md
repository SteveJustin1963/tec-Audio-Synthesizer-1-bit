```
Q: Now listen here Bond, the tec-1 has only a 1-bit audio system, 
but I can make it produce more than a square wave. 
Bond: A 1-bit audio-synthesizer on the tec-1, you've got to be joking ? 
Q: I never joke Bond! What's more later we'll add a DAC and with a bit of funding an ADC as well.
Bond: OK...(looking around) And whats this thing do?
Q: Don't touch that, that's my lunch!
