```
Q: Now listen here Bond, the tec-1 has only a 1-bit audio system, 
but I can make it produce more than a square wave. 
Bond: A 1-bit audio-synthesizer on the tec-1, you've got to be joking ? 
Q: I never joke Bond! And what's more, later with a bit of funding we'll add a DAC and ADC as well.
Bond: OK Q, (looking around), and whats this thing do?
Q: Don't touch that, that's my lunch!
